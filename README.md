## Contributing
### Adding bible passage readings for future sermons
Add rows to `src/resources/data/passages.csv` **making sure that the dates are in `YYYY-MM-DD`
format.** If you're using Excel, select the date column, *Format > Cells* and select the
`YYYY-MM-DD` format.

### Running and testing locally:
- Install dependencies by running `pip install -r src/requirements.txt`
- Add these environment variables:
  - `LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT` - the file path of the `src/` directory
  - `PYTHONPATH` - the file path of the `src/` directory
- Make the file, `src/secrets.py`, containing API keys and the like. Copy across the content from
  `src/secrets.py.template` and either get your own keys or email me
  
### TODO:
- [] Add tests
- [] Migrate bible passage database from static csv file to Google Sheets
- [] Investigate licencing for using NIV bible
- [] Improve handling of errors in general
- [] Add instructions for forking and using for other churches, including deployment etc.
